# Process Scheduling Simulator
The "Process Scheduling Simulator" is a Java GUI application designed to simulate process scheduling algorithms. It allows users to input arrival time, burst time, and priority of processes, then simulate various scheduling algorithms to observe their behavior.

The application utilizes Java's Swing library for building the graphical user interface (GUI), providing components like text fields, buttons, and text areas for user interaction and displaying results. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where the GUI components serve as the View, the simulation logic as the Model, and event listeners as the Controller.

The main components include text fields for inputting process parameters, buttons for adding processes and triggering simulation, and a text area for displaying simulation results. Users can add multiple processes with different parameters and then simulate scheduling algorithms, which can be implemented within the simulate() method.

The program employs basic Java programming concepts such as event handling, exception handling, and object-oriented principles. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of collections (specifically, ArrayList) to manage process data efficiently. Overall, it provides a simple yet illustrative tool for understanding process scheduling algorithms in operating systems.
